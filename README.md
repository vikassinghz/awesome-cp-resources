## 📚 Best Practices

### Problem Solving Strategy
1. **Read Carefully** - Understand the problem constraints
2. **Analyze Patterns** - Identify similar problems
3. **Implement Solution** - Code the optimal approach
4. **Test Edge Cases** - Handle corner cases

### Performance Tips
- Use efficient data structures
- Optimize time complexity first
- Then optimize space complexity
- Profile your code for bottlenecks

## 🚀 Getting Started with Competitive Programming

1. Choose your primary language (C++, Python, Java)
2. Master basic data structures
3. Practice simple problems first
4. Gradually increase difficulty
5. Review solutions and learn patterns
6. Participate in contests
7. Analyze top solutions
